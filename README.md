# WebChat

> Chat with anyone on any website





This is an anonymous chat browser extension that is decentralized and serverless, utilizing WebRTC for end-to-end encrypted communication. It prioritizes privacy, with all data stored locally.

 The goal is to address the issue of delayed replies on websites by adding instant messaging capabilities to any site, allowing for chatting anytime, anywhere.



### Example

### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

In addition to the great idea of decentralized chat, it also leverages some fantastic technologies.

* **[remesh](https://github.com/remesh-js/remesh)**: A frontend framework that implements DDD principles in code, achieving true separation of UI and logic. This provides a robust structure that can be easily migrated to other frontend frameworks like Vue.

* **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: A beautiful UI library and a pioneer of no-install options, with unmatched ease of customizing styles.

* **[wxt](https://wxt.dev/)**: This is the best framework Iâ€™ve used for building browser extensions, bar none.

* **[trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero)**: The core dependency for implementing decentralized communication, enabling connections to decentralized networks like IPFS, torrent, Nostr, etc.
